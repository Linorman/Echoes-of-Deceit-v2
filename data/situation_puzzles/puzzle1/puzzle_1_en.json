  "answer": "My two older brothers are twins. We have always been very close since we were young, sleeping in the same bed. The eldest brother sleeps on my left, and the second brother sleeps on my right. After more than ten years, I have gotten used to it. But one day, the second brother died of a serious illness. The right side of my bed was left empty. I felt very uncomfortable, and suddenly I thought of it! If I cut the eldest brother in half, wouldn't that be fine? Tonight, I slept very soundly.",
