# Turtle Soup (Situation Puzzle) Rules

### What is a Turtle Soup / Situation Puzzle?

A **Situation Puzzle** (often called **Turtle Soup** in some regions) is a lateral thinking game played by a group of people. It involves a mysterious, often macabre, story that is only partially revealed.

### Roles

1.  **The Host (DM / Narrator):**
    *   Knows the full story (the "Soup Bottom").
    *   Presents a short, puzzling scenario (the "Soup Surface") to the players.
    *   Answers the players' questions.

2.  **The Players (Detectives):**
    *   Listen to the scenario.
    *   Ask questions to uncover the hidden details and reconstruct the full story.

### Gameplay Loop

1.  **Presentation:** The Host reads the scenario (the puzzle statement).
2.  **Investigation:** Players ask questions to the Host.
3.  **Feedback:** The Host answers the questions.
4.  **Resolution:** Once the players have gathered enough information, they propose a solution (the full story). If correct, the game ends. If not, the investigation continues.

### Rules for Questions

The most critical rule of the game is the restriction on questions. Players can generally only ask questions that can be answered with:

*   **YES** (The assumption in the question is correct)
*   **NO** (The assumption is incorrect)
*   **YES AND NO** (The question has elements of both, or is correct in one sense but not another)
*   **IRRELEVANT** (The question does not matter to the solution)

*Note: In some variations, the Host may provide short clarifications if a "Yes" or "No" would be misleading, but strict adherence to these four answers is the standard.*

### Example

*   **Scenario:** A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender pulls out a gun and points it at him. The man says "Thank you" and leaves. Why?
*   **Player:** Was the man thirsty?
*   **Host:** No.
*   **Player:** Was the gun real?
*   **Host:** Yes.
*   **Player:** Was the man scared?
*   **Host:** Yes (at first).
*   **Solution:** The man had the hiccups. The bartender realized this and scared him with the gun to cure the hiccups. The man realized he was cured and thanked the bartender.
