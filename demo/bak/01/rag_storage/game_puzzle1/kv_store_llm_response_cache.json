    "return": "Yes, the setting described in the puzzle is quite unusual for several reasons:\n\n- **Sibling Bedsharing** – The narrator, his eldest brother, and his second brother all grew up sharing a single bed. This is atypical for siblings, especially when they are twins, as most families give each child their own sleeping space.  \n- **Twins** – The two older brothers are twins, which adds another layer of uniqueness to the arrangement, with one brother sleeping on the left side and the other on the right.  \n- **Tragic Turn** – The second brother’s death from a serious illness left the right side of the bed empty, and shortly thereafter the narrator killed his eldest brother. The progression from shared childhood intimacy to violent conflict is a striking narrative twist.\n\nThese elements—continuous shared sleeping, twin siblings, and the subsequent death and murder—make the setting highly atypical.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] Puzzle statement: “I have two older brothers, and the three of us have slept in the same bed since we were young. One day, my second brother died of illness, and shortly after, I killed my eldest brother.”  \n- [2] Puzzle answer: “Puzzle answer: My two older brothers are twins... After more than ten years, I have gotten used to it... But one day, the second brother died of a serious illness... If I cut the eldest brother in half, wouldn't that be fine?

We have always been very close since we were young, sleeping in the same bed. The eldest brother sleeps on my left, and the second brother sleeps on my right. After more than ten years, I have gotten used to it. But one day, the second brother died of a serious illness. The right side of my bed was left empty. I felt very uncomfortable, and suddenly I thought of it! If I cut the eldest brother in half, wouldn't that be fine? Tonight, I slept very soundly.",
