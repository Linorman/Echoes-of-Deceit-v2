The eldest brother sleeps on my left, and the second brother sleeps on my right. After more than ten years, I have gotten used to it. But one day, the second brother died of a serious illness. The right side of my bed was left empty. I felt very uncomfortable, and suddenly I thought of it! If I cut the eldest brother in half, wouldn't that be fine? Tonight, I slept very soundly.",
